# Multiple platforms design

Some project setups of increasing complexity. From simplest to most complex:

1. `disjoint-tests`
2. `disjoint-platform-binaries_distinct-lockfiles`
3. `disjoint-platform-binaries_shared-lockfile`
4. `tests-with-common-library`

Note that the Python files are all empty and only there for the file structure.
